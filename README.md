# Bank_Loan_risk_and_performance_analytics_dashboard
End-to-end bank loan risk and performance analytics dashboard built in Excel, transforming raw lending data into executive-level business insights.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Banks and lending institutions must continuously monitor loan performance to minimize default risk and maximize profitability.

In this project, I built an interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes loan applications, funding activity, repayment behavior, and borrower risk characteristics.

This simulates a real-world financial analytics use case.

### 🎯 What I Delivered

- An executive-style dashboard that:

- Tracks total applications and funding growth

- Measures portfolio quality (Good vs Bad loans)

- Evaluates repayment performance

- Identifies high-risk borrower segments

- Analyzes trends by state, purpose, term, and employment length
